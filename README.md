# **Human-Like Auto Typer - Final Documentation**  

## **Overview**  
A stealthy Python automation tool that perfectly mimics human typing patterns, designed to bypass revision history analysis and typing detection systems. This program replicates natural writing behavior with configurable imperfections, delays, and realistic error correction patterns.

## **Core Features**  

### **Authentic Typing Simulation**  
- **Dynamic Speed Variation**  
  - Adjustable words-per-minute (WPM) rate  
  - Randomized pauses between sentences (0.8-2.4 seconds)  
  - Natural finger fatigue simulation (speed decay over time)  

### **Advanced Error Modeling**  
- **Cognitive Error System**  
  - Context-aware wrong word substitutions  
  - Hesitation before corrections (0.4-1.2 seconds)  
  - Multi-stage error chains (typo → backspace → retype → new typo)  
- **Keyboard Physics**  
  - QWERTY adjacency typos (weighted probability)  
  - Shift-key timing imperfections  
  - Caps lock mistake simulation  

### **Control & Evasion**  
- **Foreground Process Masking**  
  - Random GUI minimization/restoration  
  - Background thread priority adjustment  
- **Anti-Detection Measures**  
  - Variable initial delay (2-8 seconds)  
  - Mouse micro-movements during typing  
  - System idle time simulation  

## **User Interface**  

### **Main Control Panel**  
- **Text Input**  
  - Smart paragraph formatting  
  - Placeholder text templates  
- **Behavior Customization**  
  - Personality presets (Careful, Average, Sloppy)  
  - Advanced timing controls  
  - Error complexity scaling  

### **Floating Monitor**  
- Real-time WPM display  
- Error counter  
- Emergency stop shield (Ctrl+Alt+Del bypass)  

## **Usage Specifications**  

### **Input Parameters**  
| Parameter          | Description                    |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Total Duration     | HH:MM format                   |
| Active Time        | Actual typing duration         |
| Typo Rate          | Per-character error chance     |
| Wrong Word Rate    | Full word substitution chance  |

### **Critical Limitations**  
⚠ **Absolute System Lockout**  
- Complete PC unusability during operation  
- All user inputs are blocked/overridden so you cannot use your pc due to mimicing your keyboard  

⚠ **Environmental Requirements**  
- Target window must:  
  - Remain in foreground  
  - Use standard text input  
  - Have no input validation    

## **Future Development Roadmap**  
- **v2.0** - Machine learning typing profiles  
- **v2.1** - Distributed typing across multiple windows  
- **v3.0** - OS-level driver for complete input masking
